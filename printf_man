.SH NAME _printf
_printf Function: Print Formatted Output
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf is a versatile function that allows users to display formatted output in various ways. It supports printing strings, characters, numbers, and string literals based on user-defined formats. Furthermore, it provides the added benefit of returning the length of the printed characters.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function provides flexible printing capabilities by following a simple pattern. Users can utilize this function by specifying a format string as the first parameter, which can include placeholders for values to be printed. The format string can contain a combination of plain text and format specifiers indicated by the '%' symbol, such as %s, %c, %i, and %d, for strings, characters, integers, and decimals, respectively.
.PP
When invoking _printf, users pass the format string as the first argument, followed by any additional values corresponding to the format specifiers. These values will replace the placeholders in the format string during printing.
